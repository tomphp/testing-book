**Testing Strategies** gives you quick guidance on approaches for automating the testing of different aspects of your system.

## Why Test

When building _software systems_, we want enough tests in place to give us the **confidence** that we can deploy to production. While [Continuous Deployment](./glossary.md#continuous-deployment) might not be your end goal, testing to a level where you have enough confidence to do so is a worthy aspiration.

## Approach

This resource serves as a strategy cookbook that gives you options for automating the testing of different aspects of your system. These aspects include:

- [Software Testing](./software-testing/index.md)
- User Interface Testing [TODO]
- Integration Testing [TODO]
- Security Testing [TODO]
- Performance Testing [TODO]
- Infrastructure Testing [TODO]
- Specialist Testing (e.g. AI, data processing) [TODO]

Depending on your circumstance different approaches to testing might be viable. Rather than presenting you with the _one true way_ to test a specific thing, we present the options and the pros and cons of each. Often, a better approach to testing will be to change your system architecture, we will suggest approaches that will advocate this, but also alternatives for when it is not possible.
